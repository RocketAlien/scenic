##Scenic 3D Engine

Scenic is a very light-weight 3D engine for creating 3D environments for first/third-person shooter games.

Scenic is written in C++ using OpenGL immediate mode rendering, and uses Lua DSL for creating
3D environments out of simple textured geometrical primitives.

Scenic has skyboxes, stencil reflections, projective shadows, particle effects and rudimentary physics.

Ongoing developments include invisible object culling via intersection of hierarchical bounding volumes
with the view frustum, as well as collision detection.

Scenic uses GLUT for the windowing system, and can be built unmodified for PC, Linux or Mac.

Planned feature list TBA.

Here are some screenshots of Scenic in action.
